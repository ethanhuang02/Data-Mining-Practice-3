Data Mining Practice #3  
Consider data set ‘Glass.txt’ for discretization.  
* Perform equal-width with ten bins, equal-frequency with ten bins, and the entropy-based discretization on the continuous attributes.  
* For each discretization method, perform the selective naïve Bayes to find an attribute subset for classification.
